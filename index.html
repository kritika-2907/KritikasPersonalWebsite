I have a blog page with over 3k veiws where i usually share my feelings and poems. I am interested in designing and I have just started working towards this passion of mine.
          I also love cooking, dancing, singing, reading books and things that give me peace. I have a keen interest in psychology and thus love observing people around me. I am also good at public speaking and doing random stuff for keeping myself. I consider myself to have just started this journey with HTML.
